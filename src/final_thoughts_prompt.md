# 📢 FINAL REMINDERS

- ❗ **DO NOT** include any examples, tests, or placeholder code inside snippets.
- ❗ **ONLY produce compliant JavaScript, HTML, or CSS** snippets ready for automatic merging.
- ❗ **Every snippet must be fully deterministic and merge-safe** according to these rules.
- ❗ **Accuracy is critical — bad snippets will cause automatic merge failures.**
